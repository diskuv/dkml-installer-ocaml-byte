ShortDescription: DkML Bytecode Edition, a Windows-friendly distribution of OCaml.
Description: |-
  The DkML distribution is an open-source set of software that supports
  software development in pure OCaml. The Bytecode Edition is a less powerful
  but faster-to-install version of the DkML distribution developed for
  beginners and students. The Edition's strengths are its:

  ✓ full compatibility with OCaml standards like Dune and ocamlfind
  ✓ ease-of-use through simplified installers and simple productivity commands;
    high school students should be able to use it
  ✓ security through reproducibility, versioning and from-source builds

  These alternatives may be better depending on your use case:

  * Developing in a Javascript first environment? Have a look at Esy and Reason
  * Developing operating system kernels? Have a look at Mirage OS
  * Developing Linux server software like web servers? Plain old OCaml on
    Debian, etc. works well
  * Writing compilers or proofs? Plain old OCaml works really well

  Commercial tools and support are available from Diskuv for mixed
  OCaml/C/C++/Java/Swift development; however, this pure OCaml winget package
  has limited support for pure OCaml development. Contact
  support AT diskuv.com if you need OCaml/C/C++/Java/Swift development.
